        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Sundubu is an absolutely <em>delicious</em> and <em>soulful</em> Korean stew. 
            It is somewhat spicy with a fiery flavor, with soft tofu, vegetables, and a protein 
            of your choice. This recipe will use seafood.</p>
            <p>It is my personal favorite dish, and I don't think I will ever get tired of it.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients (<em>serves 1 or 2</em>)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>¼ cup gochugaru (Korean hot pepper flakes)</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                <li>¼ cup (about 1 ounce) chopped onion</li>
                <li>1 large king oyster mushroom (or ½ cup of any mushrooms), chopped</li>
                <li>1 large green onion (dae-pa) or 2 green onions, the white part and green part separated and chopped</li>
                <li>2½ cups anchovy kelp stock (or vegetable stock, or beef or chicken broth)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce (or salt to your taste)</li>
                <li>2 tubes soft tofu (or 22 ounces silken tofu)</li>
                <li>2 to 3 large deveined shrimp in the shell, rinsed</li>
                <li>6 fresh shucked or shucked frozen oysters, rinsed</li>
                <li>4 to 6 fresh mussels, cleaned and rinsed</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the hot pepper flakes, sesame oil, and black pepper in a small bowl. Mix well with a spoon
                     until the hot pepper flakes absorb all the oil. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, garlic, the chopped 
                    white part of the green onion, and mushroom. Stir with a wooden spoon until the onion and garlic are
                     slightly brown and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the stock. Cover and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until
                    it is boiling vigorously.</li>
                <li>Add shrimp, oysters, and mussels. Cut the tubes of tofu in half and squeeze them into the boiling stew, 
                    and then break up the tofu a bit with a wooden spoon. If using silken tofu, scoop or squeeze from the 
                    box into the stew.</li>
                <li>Add the fish sauce (or salt to your taste), half of the hot pepper mixture, and stir a few times.</li>
                <li>Cover and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until the seafood is fully cooked and the broth is infused with its 
                    savory flavor.</li>
                <li>Add the rest of the pepper flakes and boil vigorously</li>
            </ol>
