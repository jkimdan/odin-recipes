        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Jjajangmyun is a Korean Chinese black-bean noodle dish. Its taste is impossible to describe, but 
                it is another one of my personal favorites! For Americans, the look might be off-putting, but 
                it tastes absolutely incredible.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Stir-fry the pork belly in a large, deep wok (or pan) with 1 tablespoon of 
                    vegetable oil for about 4-5 minutes, until golden brown and crispy.</li>
                <li>Pour out the excess pork fat.</li>
                <li>Add radish and stir fry for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Add potato, onion, and zucchini and keep stirring for about 3 minutes 
                    until the potato looks a little translucent.</li>
                <li>Clear a space in the center of the wok by pushing the ingredients to the edges.</li>
                <li>Add 2 Tablespoons of vegetable oil to the center of the wok, then add ¼ cup of 
                    black bean paste and stir it with a wooden spoon for 1 minute to fry it. Then 
                    mix everything in the wok and keep stirring.</li>
                <li>Add  2 cups of water to the wok and let it simmer and cook with the lid closed 
                    for about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Open the lid and taste a sample of the radish and potato. If they're fully 
                    cooked, stir in the starch water little by little. Keep stirring until it's 
                    well mixed and thick.</li>
                <li>Add the sesame oil and remove from the heat.</li>
                <li>Make jjajang noodles and add sauce and mix. Add garnish.</li>
            </ol>
